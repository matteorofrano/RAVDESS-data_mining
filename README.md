# RAVDNESS-data_mining
The following repository contains the data mining 2 university project. The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) contains 7356 files (total size: 24.8 GB).
The database contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent.
Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. 
Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. 
All conditions are available in three modality formats: Audio-only (16bit, 48kHz .wav), Audio-Video (720p H.264, AAC 48kHz, .mp4), and Video-only (no sound).

Our project is divided in 2 part: the first one containe all the data mining steps applied to the structured data version of the dataset while in the second part we use the original time series data that comes from audio or speech files.
All the procedures and techniques we used are presented in the report named "data_mining_2".
